    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>Chungdi malai is one of the most coveted dishes of Puri (a city in eastern India). It showcases the elegant flavors that are the trademark of the regional Oriya cuisine. Coconut milk and shrimp are natural dancing partners, rounded out with the earthy note of ghee laced with a tapestry of spices. The shrimp should be marinated for about 1 hour to infuse them with flavor, but otherwise this dish comes together quickly, making it an ideal family meal on a weekday that calls for something special.</p>
